# Heart_disease_predictor

#### Problem defination
  Given a patient's medical conditions can we predict whether a patient a heart disease or not.
#### Data
The original dataset came from UCI machine learning repository https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+disease

THe actual data is available on kaggle also 
##### Features
1. age: age in years
2. (sex)=0-female ,1-Male
3. cp: chest pain type

     Value 1: typical angina
     Value 2: atypical angina
     Value 3: non-anginal pain
     Value 4: asymptomatic
4. trestbps: resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
5. chol: serum cholestoral in mg/dl
6. fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
7. restecg: resting electrocardiographic results
    Value 0: normal
    Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST         elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)
8. thalach: maximum heart rate achieved
9. exang: exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
10. oldpeak = ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
11. slope: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
      Value 1: upsloping
      Value 2: flat
      Value 3: downsloping
12. ca: number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
13. thal: 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
14.  num: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
     Value 0: < 50% diameter narrowing
